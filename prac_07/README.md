# Practical 07

This repository contains my practical work for **CP1404 Programming II**, where I have learned and applied Python programming concepts, clean code practices, and version control using Git and GitHub.

## About Me

- **Name**: Rozakhun Dastan

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names to make code self-explanatory.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each function or class should have one clear purpose.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Follow PEP8 standards and use tools like PyCharm's "Reformat Code" to maintain consistency.
